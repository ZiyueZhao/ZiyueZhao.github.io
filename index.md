# Welcome to Ziyue Zhao's Homepage!

I am currently a PhD student at the [Institute for Communications Technology](https://www.ifn.ing.tu-bs.de/en/ifn/), TU Braunschweig, Germany. My research fields include transcoded speech enhancement, deep learning methods, and robust speech and audio decoding. 

I will briefly introduce my publications and research work here.

  Abstract: Low bit rate vector quantization (VQ) is omnipresent in todayâ€™s media transmission. With IP-based transmission the situation is that source-coded bits are typically either lost/deleted as a whole frame/packet, or they are received correctly. Assuming correctly received VQ symbols we show how to exploit vector-to-vector (i.e., residual temporal) redundancy at the decoder side for an improved reconstruction. It turns out that a feedforward neural network is an effective means for predicting better reconstruction vectors at the receiver in a system-compatible fashion, gaining up to 1 dB SNR depending on signal correlation and bit rate.
